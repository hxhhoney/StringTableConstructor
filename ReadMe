#StringTableGenerator
By Cathy Huang
1.Function:
This is a simplified version of string table generator.
Automatically generate stringtables_<lang>.xml and store them in the required directory(output_tree). 

2.Structure:
(1)Database:This file includes all information to build our MySql to store our strings.
(2)Source: Source code.
(3)Binary: jar files to execute. Notice StringTable.jar is our jar and jar in lib is our dependent jar(for sql). We should set our class path correctly in the build.xml under Ant.


3. How to run:
Open Terminal, and go to StringTableConstructor/Binary
Set up HU_TYPE or other input arguments in build.xml. Here it is “VIP”, for other information please refer to Database.

Then, type: ant run.

4. Result: you will see there are required stringtable_<lang>.xml generated and stored under output_tree.
